# PodGo

> PodGo is a podcast manager application for Android systems. This is a side-project of mine that I'm working on in order to learn more about Android development. Feel free to use or build upon what I've done, but understand that I'm by no means an expert on Android development. Most of the core functionality is complete; however, there are still a lot of improvements that still need to be made.

## Getting Started

> This project was made using the Android Studio IDE. To contribute, simply clone this repository and open the project folder in your IDE.
